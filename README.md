# Banker's Algorithm Implementation in Python

This is a Python implementation of the banker's algorithm for resource allocation in an operating system. The banker's algorithm is used to determine whether a set of processes can be safely executed by the operating system, without causing a deadlock or other problems due to resource contention.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository or download the code as a ZIP file.
2. Open the terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the code is saved.
3. Run the program by typing `python banker_algorithm.py`.
4. Enter the number of processes and number of resources when prompted.
5. Enter the allocation matrix, maximum matrix, and available matrix when prompted.
6. The program will output the allocation matrix, maximum matrix, need matrix, and available matrix.
7. If a safe sequence of processes can be executed, the program will output the safe sequence. If not, the program will indicate that no safe sequence exists.

## Input Format

The input format for the allocation matrix, maximum matrix, and available matrix is as follows:

### Allocation Matrix

The allocation matrix represents the number of resources currently allocated to each process. It should be entered as a series of integers separated by spaces. Each row represents a process and each column represents a resource.

Example:

```
Enter allocation matrix:
0 1 0
2 0 0
3 0 2
2 1 1
0 0 2
```

### Maximum Matrix

The maximum matrix represents the maximum number of resources that each process could potentially request. It should be entered as a series of integers separated by spaces. Each row represents a process and each column represents a resource.

Example:

```
Enter maximum matrix:
7 5 3
3 2 2
9 0 2
2 2 2
4 3 3
```

### Available Matrix

The available matrix represents the number of resources currently available. It should be entered as a series of integers separated by spaces.

Example:

```
Enter available matrix:
3 3 2
```

## Output Format

The program will output the allocation matrix, maximum matrix, need matrix, and available matrix in the same format as the input.

If a safe sequence of processes can be executed, the program will output the safe sequence as a list of integers.

Example:

```
Safe sequence is: [1, 3, 4, 0, 2]
```

If no safe sequence exists, the program will output the following message:

```
No safe sequence exists.
```
